Used KNN Classifier algorithm to build the model.
Data set containing gmat score, gpa, work experience is taken from kaggle.com
predicted confusion matrix and accuracy = 1 by taking n_neighbours=3 (any odd number) to avoid the confusion state.
Build a model to predict possibility of admission by giving values of Gmat score, Gpa and Experience.
